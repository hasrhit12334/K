# Mastering Revit Door Families: A Comprehensive Guide (and Free Resources!)

Doors are fundamental elements in any architectural design, providing access, security, and contributing significantly to the overall aesthetic. In Revit, doors aren't just lines on a plan; they are intelligent, parametric families that can be customized to an incredible degree. Understanding how to create and manipulate Revit door families is a crucial skill for any architect, BIM modeler, or designer working with Revit. This guide will walk you through the key concepts, processes, and best practices for working with Revit door families, and will also provide resources to further your knowledge.

## Understanding Revit Families: The Foundation of Door Design

Before diving into doors, it's essential to understand the concept of "families" in Revit.  A Revit family is a group of elements with a common set of properties, graphical representation, and behaviors. Think of it as a template or a definition. Doors, windows, walls, furniture â€“ all are families.  Families come in two primary flavors:

*   **System Families:** These are predefined within Revit and are fundamental to the software's structure. Walls, roofs, floors, and ceilings are examples of system families. You can modify their types and properties, but you can't create entirely new system families from scratch.

*   **Loadable Families:** These are external files (.rfa) that you load into your project. Doors, windows, furniture, and equipment are typically loadable families. You have much greater freedom in creating and customizing loadable families. Door families fall into this category.

## Why Master Revit Door Families?

Investing time in understanding and mastering Revit door families offers several significant advantages:

*   **Design Flexibility:** Create doors that precisely match your design intent, from simple single doors to complex custom entrances.
*   **Accuracy and Consistency:** Ensure accurate representation of doors in your models, reducing errors and improving construction documentation.
*   **Parametric Control:** Easily adjust door dimensions, materials, and other properties throughout your project. Changes ripple through the model automatically, saving time and minimizing mistakes.
*   **BIM Compliance:** Create intelligent door families that contain all the necessary information for BIM workflows, including manufacturer details, fire ratings, and other critical data.
*   **Efficiency:** Develop a library of custom door families that can be reused across multiple projects, saving significant time and effort.
*   **Collaboration:** Share custom door families with your team and clients, ensuring consistent design and communication.

## Creating a Basic Revit Door Family: Step-by-Step

Let's walk through the process of creating a simple single door family from scratch.

1.  **Create a New Family:**
    *   Go to "File" > "New" > "Family".
    *   In the "New Family" dialog box, select the "Metric Door.rft" (or "Imperial Door.rft" for imperial units) template. This template provides a basic host wall opening and some pre-defined parameters.

2.  **Understanding the Template:**
    *   The template shows a wall opening. This is where your door will be hosted.
    *   You'll see reference planes that define the width and height of the opening. These are already parameterized (linked to dimensions that can be changed).

3.  **Defining the Door Frame:**
    *   Use the "Extrusion" tool (Create > Forms > Extrusion) to create the door frame.
    *   Sketch the outline of the frame within the wall opening. Ensure the frame aligns with the reference planes.
    *   Lock the frame geometry to the reference planes using the "Align" tool (Modify > Align) and clicking the lock icon. This ensures the frame will adjust automatically when the opening size changes.

4.  **Creating the Door Panel:**
    *   Use the "Extrusion" tool again to create the door panel within the frame.
    *   Sketch the outline of the door panel, leaving a small gap for clearance.
    *   Lock the panel geometry to the reference planes and the frame.

5.  **Adding a Door Swing (Symbolic Lines):**
    *   Go to the "Ref. Level" (Reference Level) floor plan view.
    *   Use the "Symbolic Line" tool (Annotate > Detail > Symbolic Line) to draw the door swing arc.
    *   Constrain the arc to the door panel and the wall, so it moves with the door.

6.  **Adding Parameters:**
    *   Select the door frame extrusion. In the Properties palette, find the "Materials and Finishes" section.  Click the button next to the "Material" property to associate a parameter to it. Create a new family parameter called "Frame Material".
    *   Repeat this for the door panel extrusion, creating a parameter called "Panel Material".
    *   Select the width dimension of the door opening. In the ribbon, click "Label Dimension" and create a new parameter called "Width".
    *   Select the height dimension of the door opening. In the ribbon, click "Label Dimension" and create a new parameter called "Height".
    *   Now you can adjust the material and dimensions of the door family via project parameter.

7.  **Family Types:**
    *   Go to the "Create" tab and click "Family Types".
    *   Here you can define different door sizes and materials. Click "New" to create a new type. Enter a name (e.g., "30x80 Door").
    *   Set the "Width", "Height", "Frame Material", and "Panel Material" parameters for this type.
    *   Repeat this process to create other door types.

8.  **Save the Family:**
    *   Save the family as a ".rfa" file. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Single_Door.rfa").

## Advanced Techniques: Beyond the Basics

Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore more advanced techniques to create highly customized and intelligent door families.

*   **Nested Families:**  Create complex door configurations by nesting other families within your door family. For example, you could nest a door handle family, a lock family, or a glazing family.
*   **Visibility Parameters:** Control the visibility of different parts of the door based on parameters. For example, you could make the door swing visible only in plan views.
*   **Instance vs. Type Parameters:**  Understand the difference between instance and type parameters. Instance parameters are unique to each individual door placed in your project, while type parameters are shared by all doors of the same type.
*   **Formulas:**  Use formulas to create relationships between parameters. For example, you could automatically calculate the door swing clearance based on the door width.
*   **Shared Parameters:**  Create shared parameters that can be used across multiple families and schedules. This is essential for consistent BIM data.
*   **Door Schedules:** Learn how to create door schedules that automatically extract information from your door families, such as door type, size, material, and fire rating.

## Best Practices for Revit Door Families

*   **Keep it Simple:**  Avoid over-complicating your door families. Only include the level of detail that is necessary for your project.
*   **Use Parameters Wisely:**  Carefully consider which properties should be parameterized. Over-parameterizing can make the family difficult to use.
*   **Test Thoroughly:**  Always test your door families in a sample project to ensure they behave as expected.
*   **Organize Your Library:**  Develop a well-organized library of door families for easy access and reuse.
*   **Follow BIM Standards:**  Adhere to your company's or project's BIM standards when creating door families.
*   **Proper Naming Convention:** Adopt a clear and consistent naming convention for your door families. This makes it easier to find and manage them.
