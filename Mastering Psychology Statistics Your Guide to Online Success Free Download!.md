*   **Correlation and Regression:** These techniques are used to examine the relationships between variables. You'll learn how to calculate correlation coefficients, interpret regression equations, and make predictions based on statistical models.
*   **T-tests:** T-tests are used to compare means between two groups. You'll learn about different types of t-tests (independent samples, paired samples) and how to choose the appropriate test for your research question.
*   **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):** ANOVA is used to compare means between three or more groups. You'll learn about different types of ANOVA designs (one-way, two-way) and how to interpret ANOVA results.
*   **Non-parametric Statistics:** These methods are used when the assumptions of parametric tests are not met. You'll learn about common non-parametric tests such as the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
*   **Statistical Software:** Most psychology statistics courses incorporate the use of statistical software packages such as SPSS, R, or Python. You'll learn how to use these tools to analyze data, generate graphs, and perform statistical tests.
