## Essential Transactions for Displaying Purchase Orders

SAP offers several transactions for displaying purchase orders, each with its specific purpose and functionalities. Understanding these transactions will enable you to efficiently access and analyze the required information.

*   **ME23N: Display Purchase Order** This is the primary transaction for displaying purchase orders in SAP. It provides a comprehensive view of the PO, including header data, item details, delivery schedules, and history.

*   **ME23: Display Purchase Order (Old Version)** ME23 is the older version of ME23N. While still functional, ME23N is recommended for its enhanced features and user interface.
