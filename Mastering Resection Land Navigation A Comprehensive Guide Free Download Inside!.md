# Mastering Resection Land Navigation: A Comprehensive Guide (Free Download Inside!)

Land navigation is an essential skill for anyone who spends time outdoors, whether you're a hiker, camper, hunter, or involved in search and rescue. Getting lost can be a frightening and potentially dangerous experience. While GPS devices are helpful, they can fail due to battery issues, signal loss, or damage. Therefore, knowing how to navigate using a map and compass is crucial for self-reliance and safety. One of the most valuable techniques in a navigator's toolkit is resection.

## What is Resection?

Resection is a land navigation technique used to determine your current location on a map by sighting known landmarks. In simpler terms, it's about "shooting" bearings to identifiable features and using those bearings to pinpoint where you are. It's particularly useful when you're unsure of your position and need to re-establish your bearings, or when GPS is unavailable. This technique is incredibly important when visibility is limited, but landmarks are still present and can be used for calculations.

## Why is Resection Important?

Resection offers several advantages:

*   **Self-Reliance:** It allows you to determine your location independently of electronic devices.
*   **Accuracy:** When done correctly, resection provides a relatively accurate position fix.
*   **Versatility:** It can be used in various terrains and conditions, as long as you have identifiable landmarks.
*   **Problem-Solving:** Encourages map reading and compass skills that improve overall navigational abilities.

## The Tools You'll Need

To perform resection effectively, you'll need the following:

*   **Topographic Map:** A detailed map of the area with identifiable landmarks. Ensure the map scale is appropriate for the terrain.
*   **Compass:** A compass with a sighting mechanism (e.g., lensatic compass or baseplate compass) is essential for taking accurate bearings. A compass with adjustable declination is also ideal.
*   **Protractor/Romer:** A tool for precisely plotting bearings and determining coordinates on the map. A romer integrated into your compass will provide the best results.
*   **Pencil and Paper:** For recording your measurements and calculations.

## The Resection Process: Step-by-Step

The resection process involves the following steps:

**1. Orient the Map:**

Before taking any bearings, it's crucial to orient your map to the terrain. This means aligning the map with the ground, so that features on the map match the corresponding features in the landscape. A simple way to do this is to use your compass.

*   Place your compass on the map.
*   Rotate the map and compass together until the north needle of the compass aligns with the north direction on the map (usually indicated by a grid north arrow or magnetic north arrow).

**2. Identify Prominent Landmarks:**

Look around your surroundings and identify at least two, but ideally three, prominent landmarks that are clearly visible and also identifiable on your map. These landmarks should be relatively far apart from each other to provide the best possible intersection angle. Good landmarks include:

*   Distinct hilltops or peaks
*   Water towers
*   Road junctions
*   Unique buildings or structures
*   Distinctive terrain features (e.g., a sharp bend in a river)

**3. Measure Bearings to the Landmarks:**

Using your compass, take a bearing to each of the identified landmarks. It's essential to be as accurate as possible in this step.

*   Hold the compass steady and aim the sighting device (if your compass has one) at the landmark.
*   Read the bearing from the compass. This is the *magnetic bearing* to the landmark.
*   Record the magnetic bearing for each landmark.

**4. Convert Magnetic Bearings to Grid Bearings:**

Maps use *grid north*, while your compass measures *magnetic north*. You must convert your magnetic bearings to grid bearings to accurately plot them on the map. The difference between magnetic north and grid north is called *magnetic declination*.

*   Determine the magnetic declination for the area you are in. This information is usually found on the map itself. Look for the declination diagram, which indicates the direction and amount of declination.
*   If the declination is east (magnetic north is east of grid north), subtract the declination value from your magnetic bearing.
*   If the declination is west (magnetic north is west of grid north), add the declination value to your magnetic bearing.
*   The result is the *grid bearing* to the landmark. Record the grid bearing for each landmark.

**5. Convert Grid Bearings to Back Azimuths:**

To plot the bearings on the map and find your location, you need to use the back azimuths. A back azimuth is the reverse direction of a bearing.

*   If your grid bearing is less than 180 degrees, add 180 degrees to it.
*   If your grid bearing is 180 degrees or more, subtract 180 degrees from it.
*   The result is the back azimuth for the landmark.

**6. Plot the Back Azimuths on the Map:**

Now, it's time to plot the back azimuths on the map.

*   Locate the landmark on the map.
*   Place your protractor (or romer) on the map with the center point aligned with the landmark.
*   Align the 0-degree mark on the protractor with grid north on the map.
*   Find the back azimuth angle on the protractor and make a mark on the map at that angle.
*   Draw a line from the landmark on the map through the mark you made. This line represents the back azimuth.
*   Repeat this process for each landmark.

**7. Determine Your Location:**

The point where the lines from the back azimuths intersect on the map is your approximate location. Ideally, all three lines should intersect at a single point. However, due to inaccuracies in measurement or map reading, the lines may form a small triangle. In this case, your location is likely within the triangle. Take the center point within this triangle.

## Tips for Accurate Resection

*   **Choose Landmarks Wisely:** Select landmarks that are distinct, easily identifiable on the map, and relatively far apart.
*   **Take Accurate Bearings:** Hold the compass steady and take your time to get accurate readings.
*   **Double-Check Your Work:** Verify your calculations and plotting to minimize errors.
*   **Practice Regularly:** Resection is a skill that improves with practice. Regularly practice in different terrains and conditions to become proficient.
*   **Consider Error:** Be aware that resection is not perfect. There will always be some degree of error due to inaccuracies in measurement, map reading, or landmark identification.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Failing to Orient the Map:** Orienting the map is a crucial first step. Without it, your bearings will be off.
*   **Using the Wrong Declination:** Using an incorrect declination value can lead to significant errors. Always check the declination information on your map and use the correct value.
*   **Misidentifying Landmarks:** Carefully compare the landmarks in the field to those on the map to avoid misidentification.
*   **Rushing the Process:** Resection requires patience and attention to detail. Avoid rushing the process, or you're more likely to make mistakes.

## Beyond the Basics

While this guide provides a solid foundation in resection land navigation, there's always more to learn. You can explore advanced techniques such as:

*   **Modified Resection:** Using two landmarks and a known linear feature (e.g., a road or stream) to determine your location.
*   **Intersection:** Determining the location of an unknown point by sighting known points. (The reverse of resection)
