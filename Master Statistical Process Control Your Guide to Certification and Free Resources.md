## What is Statistical Process Control (SPC)?

SPC is a method of quality control that employs statistical methods to monitor and control a process. It helps in identifying and eliminating causes of variation, ensuring that processes are stable and predictable. By analyzing data collected during the process, SPC allows you to detect trends, patterns, and outliers that might indicate a problem.

Key elements of SPC include:

*   **Control Charts:** Visual representations of process data over time, used to identify common cause and special cause variation.
*   **Data Collection:** Gathering accurate and relevant data about the process.
*   **Process Analysis:** Using statistical tools to analyze the data and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Corrective Action:** Implementing changes to address the root causes of variation and prevent future problems.
