## What is a "Tag Course"?

A "tag course" is designed to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to strategically assign keywords or labels (tags) to digital content. This can include files, documents, images, videos, articles, and even code snippets. The goal is to make it easier to find, filter, and manage information based on relevant attributes.

Think of it like organizing a library. Without a proper cataloging system, finding a specific book would be an exercise in futility. Tags act as that cataloging system for the digital world, allowing you to quickly locate precisely what you need, when you need it.
