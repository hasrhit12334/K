## Accessing the Cisco Switch CLI

Before diving into commands, let's discuss how to access the CLI. There are typically three methods:

*   **Console Port:** A direct connection using a console cable (usually RJ-45 to DB9 or USB) from your computer to the switch's console port. This is the most common method for initial configuration or troubleshooting.
*   **Telnet:** An older protocol that allows remote access. However, Telnet transmits data in plain text, making it insecure and generally not recommended for production environments.
*   **SSH (Secure Shell):** The preferred method for remote access, SSH encrypts the communication, providing a secure connection.

To connect via console, you'll need a terminal emulation program like PuTTY, Tera Term, or SecureCRT. Configure the program with the following settings (typically):

*   Baud Rate: 9600
*   Data bits: 8
*   Parity: None
*   Stop bits: 1
*   Flow Control: None

Once connected, press Enter to enter the user EXEC mode.

## Understanding CLI Modes

The Cisco IOS (Internetwork Operating System) CLI has different modes, each with specific levels of access and command availability. The most common modes are:

*   **User EXEC Mode (Switch>):**  Limited command set, primarily for viewing basic information.
*   **Privileged EXEC Mode (Switch#):**  Allows access to most monitoring commands and the ability to enter global configuration mode.  You enter this mode by typing `enable` and providing the enable password (if configured).
*   **Global Configuration Mode (Switch(config)#):**  Used to configure global settings for the switch. You enter this mode from privileged EXEC mode by typing `configure terminal` or `config t`.
*   **Interface Configuration Mode (Switch(config-if)#):**  Used to configure individual interfaces.  You enter this mode from global configuration mode by typing `interface <interface-type> <interface-number>`.
*   **VLAN Configuration Mode (Switch(config-vlan)#):** Used to configure VLAN parameters. You enter this mode from global configuration mode by typing `vlan <vlan-id>`.

You can exit any configuration mode by typing `exit`. To return to privileged EXEC mode from any configuration mode, type `end` or press Ctrl+Z.

## Essential Cisco Switch Commands

Here's a breakdown of basic Cisco switch commands, grouped by function:

**1. Basic Commands and Navigation**

*   `enable`: Enters privileged EXEC mode.  Prompt changes to `Switch#`.
*   `disable`: Returns to user EXEC mode.
*   `configure terminal` (or `config t`): Enters global configuration mode. Prompt changes to `Switch(config)#`.
*   `exit`: Exits the current configuration mode, returning to the previous mode.
*   `end`: Returns directly to privileged EXEC mode from any configuration mode.
*   `show version`: Displays the switch's software version, hardware model, serial number, and uptime. This is vital for initial inventory and troubleshooting.
*   `show running-config`: Displays the current running configuration of the switch, the configuration that is currently active.
*   `show startup-config`: Displays the configuration that will be loaded when the switch restarts (stored in NVRAM).
*   `copy running-config startup-config`: Saves the current running configuration to the startup configuration, ensuring that changes persist after a reboot. Always do this after making configuration changes!
*   `erase startup-config`: Deletes the startup configuration. This is useful when resetting the switch to its factory default settings.  Requires a reload after execution.
*   `reload`: Restarts the switch.  **Warning:** This will interrupt network connectivity.
*   `hostname <hostname>`: Sets the hostname of the switch.  This is crucial for identification and management.  Configure in global configuration mode.
*   `banner motd #<message>#`: Sets a Message of the Day (MOTD) banner, displayed to users when they log in.  Use `#` to delimit the message. Configure in global configuration mode.

**2. Interface Configuration**

*   `interface <interface-type> <interface-number>`: Enters interface configuration mode for a specific interface. Examples: `interface GigabitEthernet 0/1`, `interface FastEthernet 0/24`.
*   `no shutdown`: Enables an interface. By default, interfaces are administratively down.
*   `shutdown`: Disables an interface.
*   `description <text>`: Adds a description to an interface, useful for documenting the interface's purpose or connected device.
*   `ip address <ip-address> <subnet-mask>`: Assigns an IP address and subnet mask to a Layer 3 interface (e.g., a VLAN interface or a routed port).
*   `switchport mode access`: Configures an interface as an access port, typically used to connect to end-user devices.
*   `switchport mode trunk`: Configures an interface as a trunk port, used to carry traffic for multiple VLANs between switches.
*   `switchport access vlan <vlan-id>`: Assigns an access port to a specific VLAN.
*   `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`: Specifies the encapsulation method for trunk ports (usually 802.1Q).
*   `switchport trunk allowed vlan <vlan-list>`: Specifies the VLANs allowed on a trunk port. Use `all` to allow all VLANs.
*   `show interfaces <interface-type> <interface-number>`: Displays detailed information about a specific interface, including its status, IP address, VLAN membership, and statistics.
*   `show interfaces brief`: Displays a summary of all interfaces, including their status, IP address, and method.
*   `speed <speed>`: Manually sets the speed of an interface (e.g., `speed 100` for 100 Mbps).
*   `duplex <mode>`: Manually sets the duplex mode of an interface (e.g., `duplex full`).  `auto` is typically recommended.

**3. VLAN Configuration**

*   `vlan <vlan-id>`: Enters VLAN configuration mode for a specific VLAN.  VLAN IDs range from 1 to 4094.
*   `name <vlan-name>`: Assigns a name to a VLAN.  This is for descriptive purposes only.
*   `show vlan brief`: Displays a summary of all VLANs configured on the switch.
*   `show vlan id <vlan-id>`: Displays detailed information about a specific VLAN.

**4. Security Configuration**

*   `enable secret <password>`: Sets a strong encrypted password for privileged EXEC mode.  This is *highly recommended* instead of `enable password <password>`, which stores the password in plain text.
*   `line console 0`: Enters line configuration mode for the console port.
*   `password <password>`: Sets a password for the console port.
*   `login`: Enables password authentication for the console port.
*   `line vty 0 4`: Enters line configuration mode for the VTY lines (virtual terminal lines used for Telnet/SSH access).  `0 4` represents lines 0 through 4, allowing for 5 simultaneous Telnet/SSH sessions.
*   `password <password>`: Sets a password for the VTY lines.
*   `login`: Enables password authentication for the VTY lines.
*  `transport input ssh`: Restricts VTY access to only SSH.  This significantly improves security.
*   `service password-encryption`: Encrypts passwords in the configuration file (but uses a weak encryption algorithm; `enable secret` is still preferred).

**5. Basic Routing (Layer 3 Switching)**

* `ip routing`: Enables IP routing on the switch (required for inter-VLAN routing). This command is configured in global configuration mode.
* `interface vlan <vlan-id>`: Enters interface configuration mode for a VLAN interface (also known as a Switch Virtual Interface or SVI).
* `ip address <ip-address> <subnet-mask>`: Assigns an IP address to the VLAN interface, which acts as the gateway for devices in that VLAN.
* `no shutdown`: Enables the VLAN interface.

**6. Common Show Commands for Troubleshooting**

*   `show ip interface brief`: Shows a summary of IP interfaces, including their IP addresses and status (up/down).
*   `show mac address-table`: Displays the MAC address table, showing which MAC addresses are associated with which interfaces and VLANs. This helps with troubleshooting connectivity issues.
*   `show cdp neighbors`: Displays information about directly connected Cisco devices using the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP). This is useful for mapping the network topology.
*   `ping <ip-address>`: Sends ICMP echo requests to a specified IP address to test network connectivity.
*   `traceroute <ip-address>`: Traces the path that packets take to reach a specified IP address.

## Example Configuration: Setting up a VLAN

Here's an example of configuring a basic VLAN:

```
Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name Users
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
Switch(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access
Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
Switch(config-if)# exit
Switch(config)# interface vlan 10
Switch(config-if)# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
Switch(config-if)# no shutdown
Switch(config-if)# exit
Switch(config)# ip routing
Switch(config)# end
Switch# copy running-config startup-config
```

This configuration creates VLAN 10, names it "Users", assigns interface GigabitEthernet 0/1 to that VLAN, creates a VLAN interface (SVI) with the IP address 192.168.10.1/24, enables the interface, and enables IP routing on the switch so that communication is possible. Finally, the current configuration is saved to NVRAM.
